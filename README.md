# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains C++ implementations for essential data structures, including arrays, queues, and stacks. Each data structure is encapsulated within a class, offering various operations for manipulation.

## Array Operations

The `array1` class provides functionalities such as sorting, displaying, finding max/min, reversing, and dynamic delete/insert operations. The main function prompts the user through a menu interface, making it easy to interact with the array operations.

### How to Use

1. Instantiate the `array1` class.
2. Follow the menu-driven interface to perform array operations.
3. Compile and run the program using the provided commands.

```
g++ array_operations.cpp -o ArrayOperations
./ArrayOperations

## Queue Implementation

The queue class supports enqueue, dequeue, display, max/min, reverse, and sorting operations. The menu-driven interface in the main function facilitates seamless interaction with queue functionalities.

### How to Use

Instantiate the queue class.
Utilize the menu interface for queue operations.
Compile and run the program using the provided commands.

g++ queue_implementation.cpp -o QueueImplementation
./QueueImplementation
